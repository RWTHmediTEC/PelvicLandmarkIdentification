function vn = normalizeVector3d(v)
% Normalize a 3D vector to have norm equal to 1.
%
%   V2 = normalizeVector3d(V);
%   Returns the normalization of vector V, such that ||V|| = 1. Vector V is
%   given as a row vector.
%
%   If V is a N-by-3 array, normalization is performed for each row of the
%   input array.
%
%   If V is a M-by-N-by-3 array, normalization is performed along the last
%   dimension of the array.
